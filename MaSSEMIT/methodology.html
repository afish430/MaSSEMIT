            <h1>Methodology</h1>

            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>MaSSEMIT (<em>Massachusetts Split-Screen Emissions Mapping & Information Tool</em>) was developed by <a href="http://www.mygreencanton.net/single_pages/author.html" target="blank">Arthur Fisher</a> for consideration in the
            <a href="http://www.37billionmilechallenge.org" target="blank">37 Billion Mile Data Challenge</a>. This application is intended to inform
            transportation planning and policy decisions, with the ultimate goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from vehicle use in Massachusetts. Using data provided by the Massachusetts Vehicle Census and other sources, a series of town-level metrics have been calculated dealing with issues such as
            CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, fuel use, vehicle types, and miles driven. Using the split-screen mapping interface, users can compare patterns between any
            two of these metrics at a given time, potentially gaining insight into what factors may influence one another,
            and which communities might best be targeted for improving transportation efficiency and sustainability.</p>

            <h3>Town-Level Metrics</h3>
            <p>For metrics calculated using the Massachusetts Vehicle Census data, the second quarter of 2010 was used as the reference point, unless otherwise noted below. 
            This was done to ensure consistency with MAPC's common practice, and to prevent individual vehicles or grid cells from being counted multiple times in statistical calculations.
            A 2010 Q2 sub-dataset was derived from the 250 meter grid dataset by including only those cells indicating that quarter. A similar sub-dataset was derived from the vehicle history table,
            and the following additional filters were applied to to minimize double-counting and to make sure only the most accurate records were included: The 'inspection match' field must be true,
            the percent overlap (a reliability measure) must be over 50%, and the CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent must be greater than zero. 
            In the metric definitions below, the terms <em>grid data</em> and <em>vehicle data</em> will be used as a shorthand referring to the 2010 2nd quarter sub-datasets of the provided <em>Vehicle History Table</em> and the <em>250 Meter Grid</em>, respectively.
            For more information about the original data, see the <a href="Documentation/VehicleCensusofMA_Documentation_v1.pdf" target="blank">Documentation</a> and <a href="Documentation/Vehicle Census_Metadata.pdf" target="blank">Metadata</a>.
            <em>All town-level metrics are approximations only.</em>

                     <li><strong>Average Adjusted Vehicle MPG:</strong>
                        The <em>Adjusted MPG</em> field in the vehicle data was averaged to the town level.
                     </li>

                     <li><strong>Average Daily CO<sub>2</sub> Equivalent per Vehicle:</strong>
                        The <em>co2eqv_day</em> field in the vehicle data was averaged to the town level.
                     </li>

                     <li><strong>Average Distance (mi) from Public Transport:</strong>
                        A distance grid was created from all MBTA points (all active bus, subway, and commuter rail stops).
                        A separate distance grid was calculated from the <em>All RTA Routes</em> shapefile included in the Companion Data package.
                        The two grids were then combined, taking the minimum values, to create a final distance grid.
                        Zonal statistics were then used to calculate the average distance value for each town.
                     </li>

                     <li><strong>Average Fuel Consumed (gal/d) per Vehicle:</strong>
                        The <em>Daily Fuel Use</em> field in the vehicle data was averaged to the town level.
                     </li>

                     <li><strong>Average Miles per Day per Household:</strong>
                        The <em>Household Miles per Day</em> field in the grid data was multiplied by the <em>Household Count</em>
                        field for each grid cell to estimate the total miles driven for that cell.
                        These cell values were summed to the town level, then divided by that town's total household count.
                     </li>

                     <li><strong>Average Monthly Gas Cost per Household:</strong>
                        The <em>Average Fuel Consumed (gal/d) per Vehicle</em> metric (see above) was multiplied by 30.4 days per month, then multiplied by the
                        <em>Average Vehicles per Household</em> metric (see below),
                        then multiplied by $3.55 (This was the average cost per gallon of gasoline in MA at the time of this calculation.
                        Using the current cost rather than the 2010 cost makes for a better modern-day estimate.)
                     </li>

                     <li><strong>Average Vehicle Age (Years):</strong>
                        The <em>Model Year</em> and <em>Inspection Year</em> fields in the vehicle data were averaged to the town level.
                        The difference between these values is the approximate average vehicle age.
                     </li>

                     <li><strong>Average Vehicle MSRP:</strong>
                        The <em>MSRP</em> field in the vehicle data was averaged to the town level.
                     </li>

                     <li><strong>Average Vehicles per Household:</strong>
                        The <em>Passenger Vehicles</em> field in the grid data was summed to the town level, then divided by the total number of households in that town.
                     </li>

                     <li><strong>Count of Commercial Vehicles:</strong>
                        The <em>Commercial Vehicles</em> field in the grid data was summed to the town level.
                     </li>

                     <li><strong>Count of Households:</strong>
                        The <em>Households, 2010</em> field in the grid data was summed to the town level.
                     </li>

                     <li><strong>Count of Passenger Vehicles:</strong>
                        The <em>Passenger Vehicles</em> field in the grid data was summed to the town level.
                     </li>

                     <li><strong>Count of Total Vehicles:</strong>
                        The <em>Total Vehicles</em> field in the grid data was summed to the town level.
                     </li>

                     <li><strong>Count of ZipCar Members:</strong>
                        The <em>zcar_mem</em> field in the Companion Package's <em>zipcar_data</em> speadsheet was joined to a ZIP codes layer.
                        ZIP codes were then spatially joined to a towns layer to calculate the total count of members per town.
                     </li>

                     <li><strong>Hybrid Vehicles per Household:</strong>
                        The <em>Hybrid</em> field in the vehicle data was summed to the town level.
                     </li>

                     <li><strong>Median Household Income, 2010:</strong>
                        An average of 2010 median household incomes was taken for each town from the US Census Block Groups dataset.
                     </li>

                     <li><strong>Total Daily CO<sub>2</sub> Equivalent:</strong>
                        The <em>CO<sub>2</sub> per Day, Passenger</em> field in the vehicle data was summed to the town level.
                     </li>

                     <li><strong>Mileage Proportions (Pie Chart):</strong>
                        <em>Mileage</em> here refers to estimates of vehicle miles driven per day, <em>NOT</em> mileage in the sense of fuel economy.
                        The grid data includes several count fields categorizing vehicles by their estimated mileage per day (<em>Low Mileage Vehicles</em>, <em>Medium-Low Mileage Vehicles</em>, etc).
                        Each of these counts was summed to the town level, and relative proportions of each were calculated by dividing each count by the total count. 
                     </li>
                </ul>
